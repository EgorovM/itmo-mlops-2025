# Data Version Control Overview

## Introduction

This project uses [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/) for managing datasets and ML models. DVC is an open-source version control system for machine learning projects that works on top of Git.

## Why DVC?

DVC provides several key benefits for ML projects:

1. **Version Control for Data**
   - Track large files without storing them in Git
   - Version datasets and models like code
   - Share data and models with team members

2. **Reproducible Experiments**
   - Track dependencies between data, code, and models
   - Reproduce experiments with exact data versions
   - Compare experiment results

3. **Pipeline Management**
   - Define ML pipelines as code
   - Automate data processing and model training
   - Track pipeline dependencies

4. **Storage Integration**
   - Support for various storage backends
   - Efficient data transfer
   - Team collaboration

## Project Setup

Our DVC configuration includes:

1. **Data Storage**
   ```
   data/
   ├── raw/          # Original, immutable data
   ├── interim/      # Intermediate data
   └── processed/    # Final, cleaned data
   ```

2. **Model Storage**
   ```
   models/
   ├── trained/     # Trained model files
   └── evaluation/  # Model evaluation results
   ```

3. **Pipeline Stages**
   ```
   dvc.yaml         # Pipeline definition
   params.yaml      # Model parameters
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Data Organization**
   - Keep raw data immutable
   - Document data sources and versions
   - Use clear naming conventions

2. **Model Management**
   - Version all model artifacts
   - Track model parameters
   - Store evaluation metrics

3. **Pipeline Structure**
   - Create modular pipeline stages
   - Define clear dependencies
   - Document pipeline parameters
