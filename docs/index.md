- Experiment tracking
- Reproducible ML pipelines
- Team collaboration

### ML Pipeline

Our ML pipeline includes:

1. Data Collection and Storage
2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering
3. Model Training and Validation
4. Model Evaluation and Comparison

### Development Practices

We follow industry best practices:

- Git Flow with DVC integration
- Automated testing and linting
- Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Documentation as Code
